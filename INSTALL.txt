To build and install Specware-C, you must first have:

* OCaml, version 4.00 or later (tested on 4.02.1), which can be
  obtained from http://caml.inria.fr/

* Camlp5, version 6.06 or later (tested on 6.12), which can be obtained from
  http://camlp5.gforge.inria.fr/

* Coq, version 8.5beta1, which can be obtained from http://coq.inria.fr/ (NOTE:
  this is not the latest Coq release; Specware-C may work with 8.5beta2, the
  latest release, though it has not been tested, and it will probably not work
  with any older version of Coq at this time.)


TIPS FOR INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

To install OCaml from source (recommended, at least on OS X), download and
un-zip / un-tar the distribution, cd to the distribution directory, and type the
following sequence of commands (the second will take maybe 10-20 minutes):

./configure
make world.opt
sudo make install

To install Camlp5 from source (recommended), download and un-tar the
distribution, cd to the distribution directory, and type the following sequence
of commands:

./configure
make world.opt
sudo make install

To install Coq from source, download version 8.5beta1. (Again, this is not the
latest release; 8.5beta2, the leatest release, might work, but has not been
tested.) Un-tar the distribution, cd to the distribution directory, and type the
following sequence of commands:

./configure -opt
make world
sudo make install


BUILDING AND INSTALLING SPECWARE-C

To build Specware-C, cd to the distribution directory and type "make".

To use Specware-C, you must first add the theories directory to your Coq load
path as logical directory Specware. This can be done in one of three ways. The
most stable approach is to add the following line to the file
~/.config/coq/coqrc.8.5beta1, where "path/to/specwarecoq/theories" is replaced
by the path on your system to the theories directory:

Add LoadPath "path/to/specwarecoq/theories" as Specware.

The second way to add Specware-C to your Coq load path is to add the above line
to the top of a Coq .v file; all of the examples in the examples directory use
this approach.

Finally, Specware-C can also be added to your Coq load path on the Coq command
line, as, e.g.,

coqc ... -R path/to/specwarecoq/theories -as Specware ...

Once Specware-C has been added to your Coq load path, Specware-C can then be
used by adding "Require"ing the module Specware.SpecwareC; again, see any of the
files in the examples directory.
